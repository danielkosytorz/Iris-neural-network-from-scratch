# Neural network from scratch

## Description
Neural network for classification iris flowers. Network is trained by Particle swarm optimization algorithm.

Network has 4 inputs neurons, hidden layer with 3 neurons and output layer with 3 neurons.

The accuracy for the validation dataset is between 60% to 90%. It depends on setting parameters of the optimization algorithm.
